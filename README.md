👋🏼 Hello folks!

This project fetches data from an specific github repository and details informations like commit messages, date, author, etc. 

The user interface was designed by Tamires Lelis (https://www.figma.com/file/sFo5fwh4PLSEMGmxRbVM4s/Fernanda-Challenge-Dark-mode?node-id=1%3A3) and developed by me.

I used Bloc, clean architecture principles, unit tests and dark mode design.
